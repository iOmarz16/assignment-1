## Overview
This project is a simple personal portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It meets the requirements of Assignment 1: responsive design, interactivity, and AI integration.

## Files
- **index.html** → Structure of the website (About, Projects, Skills, Contact).
- **css/styles.css** → Styling (layout, colors, responsive design).
- **js/script.js** → JavaScript interactivity:
  - Greeting message by time of day
  - Dark/Light theme toggle (with localStorage)
  - Smooth scrolling for navigation links
  - Contact form handler (front-end only)

## Responsiveness
- Mobile-first design.
- Uses Flexbox and Grid layouts.
- Tested on desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

## Known Limitations
- Contact form has no backend (demo only).
- Images are placeholders and can be replaced with real ones later.

## Future Improvements
- Add more projects with real screenshots.
- Deploy with custom domain.
- Connect the contact form to a backend service (e.g., Formspree).
