# Report on AI Usage

 ## Utilized Tools: ChatGPT

 ## The Use of AI
 - Created HTML, CSS, and JavaScript starter code.
 - Added examples of interactive features (smooth scroll, time-based greeting, theme toggle).
 I assisted in creating templates for technical documents, AI usage, and README.
 Error-handling patterns (loading, retry, and inline form errors) were supplied.
 Code has been simplified and commented for readability.

 ## Changes I Made
 I filled in the blanks with my information (Omar, data projects).
 To fit my style, I changed the design's colors and spacing.
 File organization, local verification, and the removal of unnecessary components.

 ## Advantages: Quicker iteration and scaffolding.
 Acquired knowledge of clean JS and responsive design patterns.
 Improved code comments and documentation organization.

 ## Difficulties/Restrictions: Some AI output required customization because it was generic.
 Compatibility and accessibility are ensured through minor debugging.

 ## Learning Outcomes: Putting HTML, CSS, and JS together and planning a small project.
- Practiced creating a responsive portfolio from scratch.
- Learned how to critically review AI suggestions and improve them.

## Responsible Use
I used AI only as an assistant.
